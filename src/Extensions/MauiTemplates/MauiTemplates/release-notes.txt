What's new in ver. 1.1.1.0:

Added Xaml code snippet for BlazorWebView with shortcut titled bwv (with xmlns prefix as b).

In any of the Xaml files, type bwv and press the tab to insert the snippet.

Note: Adding xml namespace (xmlns) implicitly is not yet supported for Xaml snippets.

So in order to effectively support the BlazorWebView snippet, included the .NET MAUI Blazor namespace itself as a code snippet with a shortcut titled mb (stands for Maui Blazor).

Also includes the WPF Blazor namespace as a code snippet with a shortcut titled wb.

For the namespace, type the snippet shortcut in the context of the root element attribute and press tab to insert the same.
