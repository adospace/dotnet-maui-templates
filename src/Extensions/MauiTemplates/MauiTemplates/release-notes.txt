What's new in ver. 1.7.1.0:
---------------------------
Introduced a new parameter to include all supported packages in the Shared Class Library template.

-asp | --all-supported-packages

Which will add reference to all 6 supported NuGet packages.

Included IsExternalInit type definition to support C# Records while compiling for Xamarin.Forms

Templates have been updated to .NET MAUI GA, stable release version.

Breaking change: To make things easier, All-in-One and Class Library templates parameters for various package inclusion have been updated to Boolean parameter type.

Also check out the newly included project template for creating a Shared Class Library that produces assemblies targeting Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI.

With C# Markup, Global usings and Compiler directives, both Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI can be targeted from single project.

dotnet new sharedclasslib --name MyApp.UI

In which:

*.forms.cs source files will be specific to Xamarin.Forms
*.maui.cs source files will be specific to .NET MAUI
*.shared.cs / *.logic.cs will be common to both Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI

Run the command dotnet new sharedclasslib --help for further details.
