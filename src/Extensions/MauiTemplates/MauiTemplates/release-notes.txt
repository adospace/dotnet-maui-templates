What's new in ver. 1.7.2.1:
---------------------------
1. Added a new Item Template for creating a Custom Control and its Handler definition.

Check out the ".NET MAUI Custom View and Handler" made available in the MAUI section in the Add New Item dialog.

Ensure conditional compilation is configured for this to work properly. Refer below for enabling it.

2. Added the option to configure conditional compilation so that platform source files can be defined anywhere in the project provided they follow a naming convention as mentioned below.

This will allow maintaining related source files in the same place, especially MAUI Handlers.

*.Standard.cs - Files targeting the BCL
*.Android.cs - Files specific to Android
*.iOS.cs - Files shared with both iOS and MacCatalyst
*.MacCatalyst.cs - Files specific to MacCatalyst
*.Tizen.cs - Files specific to Tizen
*.Windows.cs - Files specific to Windows

Parameter name: -cc | --conditional-compilation

Templates have been updated to .NET MAUI GA, stable release version.

Breaking change: To make things easier, All-in-One and Class Library templates parameters for various package inclusion have been updated to Boolean parameter type.

Also check out the newly included project template for creating a Shared Class Library that produces assemblies targeting Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI.

With C# Markup, Global usings and Compiler directives, both Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI can be targeted from single project.

dotnet new sharedclasslib --name MyApp.UI

In which:

*.forms.cs source files will be specific to Xamarin.Forms
*.maui.cs source files will be specific to .NET MAUI
*.shared.cs / *.logic.cs will be common to both Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI

Run the command dotnet new sharedclasslib --help for further details.
