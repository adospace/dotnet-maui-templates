What's new in ver. 1.1.0.0:

Added Xaml code snippet for BlazorWebView with shortcut titled bwv with xmlns prefix as b.

Note: Adding xmlns is not supported for Xaml snippets, hence it's a manual action.

In any of the Xaml file, type bwv and press tab to insert the snippet.

Introduced an All-in-One .NET MAUI App Project Template.
