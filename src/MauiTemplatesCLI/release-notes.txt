What's new in ver. 1.1.0:
-------------------------
Introduced an all-in-one .NET MAUI App project template with the ability to choose 
the design pattern during project creation.

Introduced the ability to include CommunityToolkit.Maui and CommunityToolkit.Maui.Markup 
NuGet package reference while creating a new .NET MAUI App.

These options are controlled by the below parameters:

-dp | --design-pattern

Can take any one of the following values, with default option set to Plain:

Plain        - App configured to work with a single, initial screen.
Hierarchical - App configured to work in a hierarchical pattern using NavigationPage.
Tab          - App configured to work in a Tabbed fashion using TabbedPage.
Shell        - App configured to work with Routes using Shell page.
Hybrid       - App configured to work in a Hybrid fashion using BlazorWebView.

-it | --include-toolkit

Can be any of the following values: Yes | No

-it | --include-markup

Can be any of the following values: Yes | No

For more details: run this command in the terminal:

dotnet new mauiapp --help

Known Limitations:
------------------
While using the .NET CLI Templates within Visual Studio IDE, the last used values of 
the project options like the above ones are retained in the consecutive iteration 
rather than defaulting to their original values as defined by the developer.

Have already reported this issue to the VS product team and is actively being followed up, 
until this is clarified / fixed, requesting the users to make of this feature with bit of caution.

Known Issues:
-------------
When using CommunityToolkit.Maui NuGet package with Windows as a target platform, 
it ends up in the build error whereas other platform builds without any error.

This is also reported in their GitHub issue tracker and will be resolved by the respective team.
