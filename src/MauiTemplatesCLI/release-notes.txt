What's new in ver. 2.0.0:
-------------------------
Templates have been updated to support .NET MAUI on .NET 7 (RC1 - Preview release).

For projects targeting .NET 7 framework, option to add and configure Maui Maps NuGet package.

Note: If project target .NET 6 framework, selecting this option will not have any impact.

A parameter named framework has been introduced that takes either net6.0 or net7.0 as its options (with net7.0 being the default value).

dotnet new mauiapp --framework net6.0

dotnet new mauiapp -f net7.0
