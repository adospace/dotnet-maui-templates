What's new in ver. 1.6.0:
-------------------------
Included a Project Template for creating a Shared Class Library that produces assemblies targeting Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI.

With C# Markup, Global usings and Compiler directives, both Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI can be targeted from single project.

dotnet new sharedclasslib --name MySharedLib

In which:

*.forms.cs source files will be specific to Xamarin.Forms
*.maui.cs source files will be specific to .NET MAUI
*.shared.cs / *.logic.s will be common to both Xamarin.Forms and .NET MAUI

Refer to VijayAnand.Toolkit.Markup NuGet package source made available here https://github.com/egvijayanand/dotnet-maui-toolkit for a sample.
