What's new in ver. 2.0.0:
-------------------------
Templates have been updated to support .NET MAUI on .NET 7 (RC1 - Preview release).

1. A parameter named framework has been introduced that takes either net6.0 or net7.0 as its options (with net7.0 being the default value).

dotnet new mauiapp --framework net6.0

dotnet new mauiapp -f net7.0

2. For projects targeting .NET 7, option to add and configure Maui Maps NuGet package.

Note: If project target .NET 6, selecting the Maps option will NOT have any impact.

Refer to VijayAnand.Toolkit.Markup NuGet package source made available here https://github.com/egvijayanand/dotnet-maui-toolkit for a sample.
